# B10 Audit: Shim Inventory and Classification (Revised)

**Status:** Audit only — trial deletion attempted, no shim proven deletable
**Predecessor:** B9 complete (commit `f381378`, Core Verification 106/106)

---

## 1. Core Assembly Boundary

`BetterGenshinImpact.Core` compiles the following (per `Core.csproj`, `EnableDefaultCompileItems=false`):

| Layer | Count | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Linked upstream files | ~60 | `BetterGenshinImpact/` via `<Compile Include=... Link=...>` |
| Shim files | **20** | `Shim/*.cs` via `<Compile Include="Shim/...">` |
| Adapters | 4 | `Adapters/` (MacCoreRuntime, MacAutoPick, 2 Unsupported) |
| Composition | 1 | `Composition/MacAutoPickComposition.cs` |

**NOT compiled into Core:**
- `BetterGenshinImpact/GameTask/GameTaskManager.cs` (Windows upstream)
- `BetterGenshinImpact/GameTask/TaskTriggerDispatcher.cs` (Windows)
- `BetterGenshinImpact/Core/Runtime/Windows/` (Windows DI, adapters, backend)
- `BetterGenshinImpact/App.xaml.cs` (DI)

## 2. B10.1 Trial Deletion — Corrected Findings

### 2.1 Verification methodology

Source guard searches included all linked upstream files compiled via `BetterGenshinImpact.Core.csproj`, not just AutoPick:
- `BetterGenshinImpact/GameTask/AutoPick/`
- `BetterGenshinImpact/Core/Recognition/`
- `BetterGenshinImpact/GameTask/Model/Area/`
- `BetterGenshinImpact/GameTask/CaptureContent.cs`, `ITaskTrigger.cs`, `ISoloTask.cs`
- `BetterGenshinImpact/Core/Config/`, `Helpers/`, `Model/`

### 2.2 Six candidate re-evaluation

| File | Symbol(s) | Consumer(s) in linked sources | Deletable? |
|------|-----------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| `BvStubs.cs` | `Bv.ImRead()` | `PaddleOcrService.cs` — Core-linked, calls Bv.ImRead in pre-heat | **No** |
| `CoreExtensions.cs` | `ClampTo()`, `ToScalar()` | `ImageRegion.cs` [ClampTo], `RecognitionObject.cs` [ToScalar] | **No** — extension methods used by 2 linked files |
| `DrawableStubs.cs` | `DrawContent`, `VisionContext` | `Region.cs` [DrawContent ctor/PutRect/PutLine], `ImageRegion.cs` [RemoveRect, VisionContext] | **No** — drawing types used by 3 linked files |
| `GameUiCategory.cs` | `GameUiCategory` enum | `ITaskTrigger.cs` [SupportedGameUiCategory prop], `CaptureContent.cs` [field type] | **No** — enum used by 2 linked files |
| `StringUtils.cs` | `RemoveAllSpace()` | `ImageRegion.cs` [RemoveAllSpace call] | **No** — extension used by 1 linked file |
| `TaskControl.cs` | `Logger`, `CaptureToRectArea()`, `Sleep()` | `Region.cs` [Logger], `ImageRegion.cs` [Logger, CaptureToRectArea] | **No** — used by 2 linked files |

**Conclusion:** None of the 6 candidates could be deleted. The initial audit's "zero references" claim was incorrect because it only searched AutoPick, not the full ~60-file compilation closure.

### 2.3 Implication for remaining 14 shims

This result does **not** prove that all 20 shims are essential. The remaining 14 shims (`App`, `BgiKeyMapper`, `BgiOnnxFactory`, `BgiOnnxModel`, `ConfigService`, `GameTaskManager`, `Global`, `MacSystemInfo`, `PlatformServices`, `RunnerContext`, `Simulation`, `SpeedTimer`, `TaskContext`, `ThemedMessageBox`) have **not** been trial-deleted or fully audited for deletability.

B10 is not closed. Each remaining shim requires individual dependency evidence before a deletion attempt.

## 3. Current Shim Inventory and Known Consumers

| Shim | Known consumers | Evidence status |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| `App.cs` | Logger, ServiceProvider | Known direct consumer |
| `BgiKeyMapper.cs` | AutoPickAssets | Known direct consumer |
| `BgiOnnxFactory.cs` | ONNX | Known direct consumer |
| `BgiOnnxModel.cs` | ONNX | Known direct consumer |
| `BvStubs.cs` | Bv.ImRead (PaddleOcrService — Core-linked) | **Verified required** (B10.1) |
| `ConfigService.cs` | AutoPickTrigger (JsonOptions) | Known direct consumer |
| `CoreExtensions.cs` | ImageRegion (ClampTo), RecognitionObject (ToScalar) | **Verified required** (B10.1) |
| `DrawableStubs.cs` | Region, ImageRegion (DrawContent, VisionContext) | **Verified required** (B10.1) |
| `GameTaskManager.cs` | AutoPickAssets (LoadAssetImage), Verification | Known direct consumer |
| `GameUiCategory.cs` | ITaskTrigger, CaptureContent (enum) | **Verified required** (B10.1) |
| `Global.cs` | AutoPickTrigger (ReadAllTextIfExist) | Known direct consumer |
| `MacSystemInfo.cs` | TaskContext shim (default SystemInfo) | Known direct consumer |
| `PlatformServices.cs` | DesktopRegion (5 calls), Simulation, Verification | Known direct consumer |
| `RunnerContext.cs` | AutoPickTrigger (StopCount fallback) | Known direct consumer |
| `Simulation.cs` | SendInputFacade | Known direct consumer |
| `SpeedTimer.cs` | AutoPickTrigger (debug perf) | Known direct consumer |
| `StringUtils.cs` | ImageRegion (RemoveAllSpace) | **Verified required** (B10.1) |
| `TaskContext.cs` | BaseAssets, OcrFactory, AutoPickAssets | Known direct consumer |
| `TaskControl.cs` | Region, ImageRegion (Logger, CaptureToRectArea) | **Verified required** (B10.1) |
| `ThemedMessageBox.cs` | AutoPickTrigger (error dialogs) | Known direct consumer |

**Key to Evidence status:**
- **Verified required (B10.1):** Trial deletion failed; direct symbol reference confirmed in Core-linked consumer
- **Known direct consumer:** Known caller exists but no trial deletion has been attempted
- Not yet audited means the file is assumed required until proven otherwise

**What "deletion" would require:** For any shim to be removable, ALL the linked upstream files compiled in Core must stop depending on its types/namespace. This typically requires either:
- Upstream code modification (replacing static calls with injected dependencies)
- Additional `#if BGI_FULL_WINDOWS` guards
- Wrapping in the Windows-only WPF project

Those changes are beyond B10 scope (they belong to the AutoPick/OCR extraction phase or a dedicated cleanup phase).

## 4. Verification Baseline

| Metric | Current |
|--------|---------|
| Core Verification | **106/106** ✅ |
| Core build errors | Zero ✅ |
| Shim files compiled | 20 |
| adapter-gate | Not triggered (no adapter changes) |
| Full WPF build | Pre-existing backlog (IAutoPickConfigProvider missing usings) |

## 5. B10.2 Audit: BgiKeyMapper

### 5.1 Current state

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Shim file | `BetterGenshinImpact.Core/Shim/BgiKeyMapper.cs` |
| Upstream equivalent | **None** — the shim IS the authoritative source. No `Helpers/BgiKeyMapper.cs` exists in the WPF project tree. |
| Consumer(s) in Core-linked files | `AutoPickAssets.cs` line 174: `BgiKeyMapper.ToKey(keyName)` — single call site |
| Dependency chain | Pure C# → Platform.Abstractions (BgiKey enum) → no WPF/Win32/App.ServiceProvider → no transitive blockers |

### 5.2 Content comparison (shim is the only version)

- Namespace: `BetterGenshinImpact.Helpers` — same as the missing upstream target
- Method: `public static BgiKey ToKey(string key)` — single method, pure string → BgiKey mapping
- Dependencies: Only `BetterGenshinImpact.Platform.Abstractions` (BgiKey enum)
- No WPF/Win32/App.ServiceProvider/TaskContext references
- 36 lines total

### 5.3 Conclusion

**This shim can be replaced with linked shared source (Category B).**

Specifically:
1. Move `BetterGenshinImpact.Core/Shim/BgiKeyMapper.cs` → `BetterGenshinImpact/Helpers/BgiKeyMapper.cs` (WPF project tree)
2. WPF project auto-compiles it via default SDK glob
3. `BetterGenshinImpact.Core.csproj` replaces `<Compile Include="Shim/BgiKeyMapper.cs" />` with a linked reference:
   `<Compile Include="../BetterGenshinImpact/Helpers/BgiKeyMapper.cs" Link="Helpers/BgiKeyMapper.cs" />`
4. Delete `BetterGenshinImpact.Core/Shim/BgiKeyMapper.cs`

This eliminates one shim file, uses the existing shared-source pattern (same as `IAutoPickConfigProvider`, `ISystemInfo`, etc.), and has zero behavioral impact.

### 5.4 Risk

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Core build impact | None — same code, different compile item |
| Behavior change | None — single authoritative source |
| WPF build impact | None — now in WPF tree via default glob |
| Future divergence | None — single authoritative source |
| Adapter-gate | Not triggered (no adapter changes) |

### 5.5 B10.2 implementation result

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Shim file | `Shim/BgiKeyMapper.cs` | Deleted |
| Authoritative source | — | `BetterGenshinImpact/Helpers/BgiKeyMapper.cs` |
| Core compile item | `<Compile Include="Shim/BgiKeyMapper.cs" />` | `<Compile Include="../BetterGenshinImpact/Helpers/BgiKeyMapper.cs" Link="Helpers/BgiKeyMapper.cs" />` |
| WPF compile | — (not in WPF tree) | Default SDK glob |
| Shim count | 20 | **19** |
| Core Verification | 106/106 | 106/106 ✅ |
| WPF BgiKeyMapper type resolution | — | Zero errors ✅ |
| Source guard — only one definition | — | `BetterGenshinImpact/Helpers/BgiKeyMapper.cs` only ✅ |
| Source guard — old shim reference | — | Zero csproj hits ✅ |
